# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Showing empathy toward others

Examples of unacceptable behavior:
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information without permission
- Any other conduct which could be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces — including GitHub, discussions, pull requests, and offline events.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated.
