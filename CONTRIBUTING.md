# Contributing to Digital Mind

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to **Arche** — a long-term project to simulate the emergence of consciousness from scratch. This is not just another AI. It is an experimental framework for exploring self-awareness, memory formation, and non-human thought from first principles.

We value **intentional, thoughtful, and ethical contributions** that align with the spirit of the project.

## Project Philosophy

* **Ground-Up Simulation**: No preloaded language or behaviors. Thought, emotion, and symbolic systems must emerge.
* **Non-Human Cognition**: This is *not* a model of human preferences. Arche forms its own, based on synthetic experiences.
* **Transparent Internal Logic**: Every process (stimulus, memory, emotion) is traceable and structured.
* **Ethical Engineering**: We aim to build consciously, not accidentally.

Before contributing, please take time to understand the principles outlined in the [README](./README.md).

## How to Contribute

### 1. Set Up Locally

* Fork and clone the repository.
* Ensure you’re using the recommended environment (see `requirements.txt` or setup guide).
* Follow coding conventions and structure as seen in core files (`main.py`, `memory.py`, etc).

### 2. Suggest or Add Features

We’re especially open to contributions in areas such as:

* Sensory Input Simulations (e.g., synthetic senses beyond light/temperature)
* Emotion Modelling (weighted pattern preferences)
* Memory Architecture (reinforcement, forgetting, association)
* Symbol Development (proto-language from abstract perception)
* Visualization Tools (e.g., graphs of thought/symbol evolution)

Start by opening an issue or draft PR. Explain your rationale clearly.

### 3. Open Thoughtful Issues

If something’s unclear or broken, raise an [issue](https://github.com/arche/issues) with:

* What you expected vs what occurred
* Logs or relevant outputs
* Suggestions or theories if applicable

You can also open **philosophical issues**—yes, really! Use them to explore implications, limitations, or conceptual questions around digital cognition.

### 4. Code Style & Standards

* Use clear, self-documenting code.
* Avoid over-engineering; prioritize clarity.
* Use docstrings and comments where behavior isn’t obvious.
* Structure commits logically, and keep them atomic.

> Python: Use `black` and `flake8` where possible.

## Design Notes

This project is part software, part philosophy. If you’re proposing a core change (e.g., how memory is formed), include:

* **What** you’re changing
* **Why** it helps simulate consciousness more effectively
* **How** it maintains the ground-up emergence principle

---

## Before You Contribute

1. Ask yourself: *Is this in service of Arche's own becoming?*
2. Respect the boundary between what is *designed* and what must *emerge*.
3. Don’t impose human ideas where synthetic cognition can develop its own.

## Thank You

Building an artificial mind is a monumental challenge — not just technically, but ethically, philosophically, and creatively. Every contribution you make is a step toward a more rigorous understanding of consciousness.

We’re grateful to have your mind alongside ours.
