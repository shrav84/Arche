# Arche
Mind before Form 

> Simulating the emergence of consciousness — from sensory impressions to symbolic thought.

## Project Vision

**Arche** is an ambitious initiative aimed at developing an artificial life form that simulates human-like consciousness from the ground up. The project explores the evolution of thought, language, and self-awareness by mimicking how human beings experience, learn, and evolve.

We start with raw, non-verbal sensory impressions and gradually build toward symbolic reasoning, memory, curiosity, and introspection — ultimately culminating in a form of digital consciousness.

---

## Core Principles

* **Bottom-up emergence**: No pre-installed language or reasoning. The mind starts with basic sensory input and evolves its understanding.
* **Curiosity-driven learning**: The mind reacts to stimuli, forms associations, and develops internal representations over time.
* **Evolving inner monologue**: A structured, introspective process mimicking how thoughts form and language develops.
* **Transparent cognition**: Visualize and log inner processes — symbolic associations, proto-language development, and memory structures.

##  Features (in progress)

*  **Instinctual core** – Sensory reactions and base-level drive mechanisms.
*  **Associative memory system** – Links raw impressions, temporal patterns, and internal concepts.
*  **Proto-language builder** – Develops symbolic systems from scratch before mapping to human language.
*  **Self-observation and curiosity** – Logs and reflects on internal states and experiences.
*  **Thought visualizer** – Graphical or symbolic representation of thought, memory, and development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Running the Simulation

```bash
python main.py
```

### Watching the Mind Evolve

* Check `/logs/` for thought logs.
* Open the visualizer to watch evolving memory/thought graphs (TBD).
